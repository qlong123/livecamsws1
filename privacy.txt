Wallington Security Live Camera Privacy Policy
Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Wallington Security ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information collected through our website, livecams.wallingtonsecurity.co.uk (the "Website"), which displays live feeds from some of our public cameras (the "Live Cameras").

Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal data through the Website itself. However, since the Live Cameras capture video footage of public spaces, they may inadvertently capture images of individuals. This footage may contain personal data depending on the context.

Use of Information

The primary purpose of the Live Cameras is to provide public safety and security benefits. We may use the footage for the following purposes:

To monitor public areas for potential security incidents.
To assist law enforcement with investigations if necessary.
To improve the placement and effectiveness of our security measures.
To compile anonymized statistics on website traffic and usage patterns.
Disclosure of Information

We will not disclose any personal data captured by the Live Cameras to third parties without your consent, except in the following limited circumstances:

To law enforcement agencies if required by law or subpoena.
To respond to a legal process or emergency situation.
To protect the rights or safety of ourselves or others.
Data Retention

We will retain footage captured by the Live Cameras for a limited period, as determined by our internal policies and applicable laws.  After this period, the footage will be deleted securely.

Your Rights

While the Live Cameras capture images in public spaces, you may still have certain rights regarding your personal data under applicable laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if you are located in the European Union. These rights may include:

The right to access your personal data.
The right to rectification of inaccurate personal data.
The right to erasure of your personal data.
The right to object to the processing of your personal data.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information below.

Security

We take reasonable steps to secure the personal data we hold from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is ever completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data.

Children's Privacy

The Website is not directed towards children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided us with personal data, please contact us. We will take steps to remove the data from our systems.
